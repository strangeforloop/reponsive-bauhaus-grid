# reponsive-bauhaus-grid

This is an experimental exercise of using CSS Grid to represent Bauhaus aesthetic while making it responsive for the web.
<br><br>
Bauhaus is a modernist art movement often characterized by the combination of black and primary colors, geometric shapes, and simplicity.

# CSS Grid Limits and Capabilities for This Exercise
#### Limits
CSS Grid only allows the representation of squares and rectangles. In order to continue to use grid for experiment, I needed to get creative on how to represent a certain shape.

#### Capabilities
CSS Grid makes it very easy to create responsive experiences with `grid-template-areas`. I used this to define and refine the layout.

# Improvements
1. Maintain aspect ratios of shapes as the design grows and shrinks.
2. Polish the breakpoints so that the responsiveness feels more natural.
